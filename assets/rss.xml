<h1>Are.na Walkthrough With Travess Smalley + Daniel Lefcourt (16 Aug 2024)</h1>
<p id="top">Herein you'll find my notes from a virtual Are.na walkthrough: <a href="https://www.travesssmalley.com/" target="_blank">Travess Smalley</a> + <a href="https://certainlynot.com/" target="_blank">Daniel Lefcourt</a>. They discussed how they use it to develop their ideas.</p>
<p class="quotes" cite="https://www.are.na/are-na-editorial/channel-walkthrough-with-daniel-lefcourt-and-travess-smalley"> Travess and Daniel are going to be talking about visualizing sound and graphic notation, and walking us through their Are.na channels collecting examples of this kind of work. Both are wonderful artists who work with generative systems, so they will also relate these practices to their own work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unrelated fields overlap in unexpected ways. Explore those disparate connections for new insights.</li>
<li>Save everything you find interesting. You never know how it might inspire something later.</li>
<li>If there aren’t words to describe what you’re researching or exploring, there’s a wealth of opportunities there.</li>
<li>Art is a language. And just as we study books to find how we write, we can study artworks to discover how we express ourselves.</li>
<li>Each painting sings the same song, uniquely.</li>
<li>When you discover something new, you want to find others like them. If the creators share their influences, you’ll discover something unique. So share yours.</li>
<li>The beauty of mixed media is you can mix and match often separate senses for surprising results. For example, sheet music as artworks.</li>
<li>Learn the rules of software to break them to make art with unusual constraints.</li>
<li>Rules are freeing when overwhelmed by the limitless of creativity, but breaking them and creating beyond them is often where the most fascinating ideas come from.</li>
<li>If you’re stuck on a problem, working it out on paper can lead to breakthroughs.</li>
<li>Our taste influences what we make. Begin with what you love and build upon it.</li>
<li>The computer is a creative assistant, a portal to inspiration, or an art medium. Experiment.</li>
<li>Creative processes as programming scripts.</li>
<li>Book or zine making is such a rewarding process as it allows for constant experimentation..</li>
<li>Paper is an excellent tool for processing information and engaging with a work.</li>

<title>Notes: Liminial Festival 2024</title>

<description>Herein you'll find my notes from attending the inaugural Liminal Festival, hosted by the magazine of the same name, held in Melbourne, Australia (live and online.)</description>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<h1>Notes: Liminal Festival 2024</h1>
<h2>Session #1: Little Fates</h2>
<p><strong>Featuring <a href="https://www.wheelercentre.com/people/danny-soberano" target="_blank">Danny Soberano</a> + <a href="https://yanyiii.com/" target="_blank">Yanyi</a>.</strong></p>
<p class="quotes" cite="https://www.wheelercentre.com/events-tickets/season-2024/little-fates-yanyi-and-danny-soberano">"Yanyi and Danny examine poetic form as a tool for untangling the self and our surrounds. How is a person known? Perhaps in the way their coffee cools; as Danny Soberano writes: ‘I knew even then / that I was changed’. Or perhaps, as Yanyi writes, it is in the hanging of a poster, or the stringing of lights across the wall. In poetry, each detail matters tenfold and weighs a tonne, but still floats easy, steam off hot coffee. In this conversation, Yanyi and Danny examine the poetic form as a tool for untangling the self and our surrounds."</p>
<ul>
<li>Cooking is a renewable skill: it keeps on giving.</li>
<li>When trying to make a positive contribution to a community, intentionality and focus is as important as it is in writing. The tinner you spread yourself, the less impact you'll have.</li>
<li>Write when no one can disturb you.</li>
<li>Concentrating for blocks of time makes space for creativity. Carve it out.</li>
<li>Write first drafts in long form prose regardless of the desired finished format to work out what you want to say and get the thoughts out.</li>
<li>Treat firsts drafts ass ideation to spark future works. Don't expect too much and let the work breathe.</li>
<li>Experiment with poetic forms to break them for powerful endings.</li>
<li>Poems are life companions.</li>
<li>Doubt is scary yet embracing it gives us rick soil to explore in our work.</li>
<li>When you write to discover what you think, it's an exciting yet uncertain process. That's what makes it so rewarding yet terrifying.</li>
<li>There's so much we don't and will never know. Poetry and prose are a chance to discover our truth.</li>
<li>Institutions and belief systems don't allow for doubt as it threatens their existence.</li>
<li>The longer you live, the less surprised you feel when trying something different.</li>
<li>Creativity goes through seasons.</li>
<li>Expressing doubt is a statement of being a free-thinking individual.</li>
<li>Reading is the only way to experience another life as if it were yours.</li>
<li>If anything you want doesn't exist, create it.</li>
<li>Archives are a community strengthener and preserver of literary history.</li>
<li>Experiences come direct from the body to the page.</li>
<li>Books as archives.</li>
<li>A weekly reflection creates a record of your existence, memories kept you'd otherwise lose.</li>
<li>Literature isn't the point. Human connection is.</li>
<li>Through reading, you connect to the dead, and the living who no longer exist.</li>
<li>Read the collected correspondence of writers for beautiful insights and turns of phrase.</li>
<li>Poetry helps us process experiences.</li>
<li>There's no such thing as a singular history.</li>
<li>Poetry's rhythm has sped up as society has.</li>
<li>Write in the voice of those you adore until there's nothing left but yours.</li>
<li>When you love the work, the separation between life and it disappears.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Session #2: Linework</h2>
<p><strong>Featuring <a href="https://www.nationalbook.org/people/lee-lai/" target="_blank">Lee Lai</a> and <a href="https://www.jilliantamaki.com/" target="_blank">Jillian Tamaki</a>.</strong></p>
<p cite="https://www.wheelercentre.com/events-tickets/season-2024/linework-jillian-tamaki-and-lee-lai" class="quotes">In this conversation, Lee Lai and Jillian Tamaki examine the tactile and embodied nature of comics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Promoting a creative work is a signal that project and life stage has finished.</li>
<li>It's okay to not be happy with past work, it shows you're improving. But let it be.</li>
<li>Dissatisfaction is a great motivator.</li>
<li>Being a beginner is a beautiful state of mind when creating. You're unencumbered.</li>
<li>Finishing things is one of the best things you can do for yourself as a maker. Get to good enough.</li>
<li>Books are eras of your existence.</li>
<li>The more you start and end the creative process, there less you have to fear.</li>
<li>Goals forever need remaking. Otherwise you're stuck in a loop of asking 'what now?'</li>
<li>You think the most satisfying thing about making stuff is the finished result, but if you want it to be a lifelong practice, you need to fall in love with the process.</li>
<li>Art doesn't have to perform usefulness. Your artmaking is one facet of your skills, many of which you possess in being able to make a positive contribution.</li>
<li>You have no obligation to speak to the moment through what you make.</li>
<li>Think of the studio as a laboratory, not a factory.</li>
<li>Strategic thinking based on the old way of doing things quickly falls apart. To survive in an ever-changing world, you also need flexibility.</li>
<li>Life is uncertainty. If you can't accept that, everything is hard.</li>
<li>When the tools available rise everyone to the same level, to stand out means being extraordinary.</li>
<li>When algorithms don't introduce you to the art you want, you need to seek it out. It's still there.</li>
<li>Embrace your fixations and learn all you can.</li>
<li>There's no one right way to appreciating art. Learn, and be inspired.</li>
<li>A work's medium and the ways of presenting it create a world of possibilities.</li>
<li>Something's execution doesn't matter as much as the intention and the meaning the audience is left with.</li>
<li>When attention is scattered and short-lived, the highest compliment is sustained, careful noticing.</li>
</ul>

<description>What I learned or found interesting from attending my first Writers Festival!</description>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<h1>Notes: Mildura Writers Festival 2024</h1>
<h2 id="day-2-session-1">Day 2: Reading + Writing Place Into Being</h2>
<p><strong>Featured <a href="https://ipcs.org.au/people/melinda-hinkson/">Melinda Hinkson</a>, <a href="https://www.melissa-lucashenko.com/">Melissa Lucashenko</a>, <a href="https://scholars.latrobe.edu.au/lmpearce">Lilian Pearce</a>, <a href="https://www.intellectbooks.com/emily-potter">Emily Potter</a> + <a href="https://nikitavanderbyl.com/">Nikita Vanderbyl</a>.</strong></p>
<p cite="http://www.mildurawritersfestival.com/uploads/1/2/1/7/121719570/mwf_digital_program24.pdf" class="quotes">"What does the practice of writing and reading about placemaking reveal and why is it a radical act? Our speakers explore the ways in which their work redefines the spirit of place."</p>
<ul>
<li>Places as an anchor in creative writing (the well from where stories spring.)</li>
<li>Words bring experiences to life in ways we never could otherwise.</li>
<li>A writer brings only half of the conversation, the reader brings the rest.</li>
<li>Stories tell you how a community sees itself and the place they live.</li>
<li>Reading seems solitary but it's still deeply social (and shares ideas.)</li>
<li>Books give us a way to start difficult conversations.</li>
<li>Write with responsibility and care. Your words change people's worlds.</li>
<li>Relationships with places are complex, writing helps us explore that.</li>
<li>Rural folks are often more attuned to their local environment</li>
<li>Our perceived separation from nature may root our environmental challenges.</li>
<li>History involves as much storytelling as fiction, just different styles.</li>
<li>Places affect us as much as we affect them.</li>
<li>Read what you're interested in. Otherwise, what's the point?</li>
<li>Every book you write is different, you learn how to do so anew.</li>
<li>Things always could be different. History wasn't inevitable and neither is the future.</li>
<li>Storytelling is shared among cultures.</li>
<li>Outsiders have the power to see through locals consider 'truth.'</li>
<li>Listening is an important (and forgotten) component of community and understanding.</li>
<li>Reading and storytelling help us create the future and new narratives.</li>
<li>What's between the lines is as important as the words themselves.</li>
<li>Learn and unlearn. Be open to new ideas.</li>
<li>Indigenous writers ask for permission before writing about another mobs' country.</li>
<li>Inaction is still action.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="day-2-session-2">Day 2: Stone Yard Devotional</h2>
<p><strong>Featured <a href="https://www.michaelwinkler.com.au/">Michael Winker</a> and <a href="https://www.charlottewood.com.au/">Charlotte Wood</a>.</strong></p>
<p cite="http://www.mildurawritersfestival.com/uploads/1/2/1/7/121719570/mwf_digital_program24.pdf" class="quotes">"Stella Prize-winning author of The Natural Way of Things, and the nonfiction work, The Writer’s Room, shares thoughts on her tenth book, Stone Yard Devotional, a meditation on themes of despair, grief and hope."</p>
<ul>
<li>As attention spans shrink, writing a slow book becomes a radical act.</li>
<li>Contemplation is a valuable skill we need to cultivate.</li>
<li>Books don't just have to tell a story, they can play with the art of the written word.</li>
<li>Vivid descriptions enliven text, but leaving room for imagination deepens immersion.</li>
<li>Being a ascetic can be ostentatious.</li>
<li>We're all running from something, but we can't run forever.</li>
<li>We all hate the mirror. What we dislike in others is what we dislike in ourselves.</li>
<li>What's more important? The frustrations of living alone, or living together?</li>
<li>Belief systems are breeding grounds for stark contradictions.</li>
<li>The urban-rural divide: a false dichotomy we often demonize or romanticize.</li>
<li>We seem to be losing complexity and nuance.</li>
<li>Writing in the 'present tense' is intimate yet claustrophobic.</li>
<li>First-person intimacy vs. third-person versatility: choose based on your narrative needs.</li>
<li>Forced proximity, a potent trope, unveils personalities and breeds meaningful conflict.</li>
<li>Stillness is terrifying because we have to confront the voices in our heads.</li>
<li>In a world of constant consumption, stillness can feel like emptiness.</li>
<li>Attention is precious and exhausting.</li>
<li>Sustain long-term projects by finding new 'heat sources' to weave into your work.</li>
<li>Describing a book as 'quiet' is a critique or compliment, depending on who uses it. </li>
<li>The less we know of someone, the more they haunt us after parting.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="day-2-session-3">Day 2: Compassion</h2>
<p><strong>Featured <a href="https://writer.com.au/">Nic Brasch</a> and <a href="http://www.juliejansonwriter.com/">Julie Jason</a>.</strong></p>
<p cite="http://www.mildurawritersfestival.com/uploads/1/2/1/7/121719570/mwf_digital_program24.pdf" class="quotes">"From the author of the Miles Franklin longlisted Madukka: The River Serpent, Compassion is an exploration of the complex and dangerous lives of Aboriginal women in 1800s colonial New South Wales."</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading and writing plays is a great way to learn good dialogue.</li>
<li>Research fuels your work and expands collective knowledge.</li>
<li>Chase curiosity. Challenge conventional wisdom (that's where the richest ideas are.)</li>
<li>Your characters are best revealed through their speech.</li>
<li>Novels are also memoirs, because everything we write comes from our experience.</li>
<li>Reading is research. Both are important for writers.</li>
<li>Good longform journalism is great inspiration for fiction.</li>
<li>If you want to keep writing, do it for yourself, and don't care what others think.</li>
<li>Play with point-of-view for experimental writing.</li>
<li>A story can be as complex as you wish, but it needs a thread to tie it together.</li>
<li>Anger is a driving force behind our best works.</li>
<li>Stories reveal the world we want to create.</li>
<li>Writing doesn't have to be solitary: community is a lifeline.</li>
<li>Improv, theatre, poetry, and playwriting enrich prose.</li>
<li>Always stand up for yourself and look after the underdog.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="day-2-session-4">Day 2: The Poet + The Sufi Singer</h2>
<p><strong>Featured <a href="https://www.wheelercentre.com/people/marjon-mossammaparast/">Marjon Mossammaparast</a> and <a href="https://farhanshahmusic.com/">Farhan Shah</a>.</strong></p>
<p cite="http://www.mildurawritersfestival.com/uploads/1/2/1/7/121719570/mwf_digital_program24.pdf" class="quotes">"A discussion of Sufism, the mystical expression of Islam, and the disciplines within it that include poetry, music, dance, and theology."</p>
<ul>
<li>Logic ends where love begins.</li>
<li>Knowledge stems from learning. Wisdom from hard-won experience.</li>
<li>Music is one of the few sources of magic left.</li>
<li>We reconnect with and escape from ourselves through art.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="day-3-session-1">Day 3: Ask The Publisher</h2>
<p><strong>Featured <a href="https://upswellpublishing.com/home/about">Terri-Ann White</a>.</strong></p>
<p cite="http://www.mildurawritersfestival.com/uploads/1/2/1/7/121719570/mwf_digital_program24.pdf" class="quotes">"The director of one of the country’s most ambitious imprints shares her passion for those difficult-to-categorise, yet impactful works of fiction, nonfiction and poetry."</p>
<ul>
<li>Passionate readers are the key to a book's success, nothing else.</li>
<li>Write the books you want to read.</li>
<li>Beyond trends lie underserved markets desperate for books.</li>
<li>Small presses can devote more time and energy to their authors.</li>
<li>Connections are everything when promoting a book.</li>
<li>Excellence stands out in a sea of mediocrity, capturing attention through its rarity.</li>
<li>Good writing requires patience. Don't rush the craft.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="day-3-session-2">Day 3: Tina Kane Emergent Writer Award</h2>
<p><strong>Featured <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/authors/254520/paul-kane/">Paul Kane</a> and <a href="https://overland.org.au/author/gareth-morgan/">Gareth Morgan</a>.</strong></p>
<p cite="http://www.mildurawritersfestival.com/uploads/1/2/1/7/121719570/mwf_digital_program24.pdf" class="quotes">"Poet, scholar and former artistic director of the Mildura Writers Festival Paul Kane (livestreamed from the USA) presents the Tina Kane Emergent Writer Award. The 2024 recipient is Gareth Morgan, co-director of Sick Leave, a monthly reading series and occasional journal, and author of Dear Eileen and When a Punk Becomes a Spunk."</p>
<ul>
<li>Write letters to people whose work captivates you.</li>
<li>Poetry can save your life.</li>
<li>Writing reviews sharpens critical thinking and deepens craft appreciation.</li>
<li>Poetry readings are excellent for meeting like-minded others.</li>
<li>Transform dissatisfaction with the status quo into your unique signature.</li>

<li>Find what feels good in your writing and hold on to it.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="day-3-session-3">Day 3: The In-Between</h2>
<p><strong>Featured <a href="http://christostsiolkas.com.au/">Christos Tsiolkas</a> and <a href="https://angelasavage.wordpress.com/">Angela Savage</a>.</strong></p>
<p cite="http://www.mildurawritersfestival.com/uploads/1/2/1/7/121719570/mwf_digital_program24.pdf" class="quotes">"The In-Between is a tender, affecting novel of love, hope, and forgiveness by the author of The Slap and Damascus. Join him and a long-time friend for an unflinching conversation about this latest work, the creative process and dedicating a life to literature."</p>
<ul>
<li>Be heretical in your writing. It's far more interesting when you have something to say.</li>
<li>If you want to be serious about writing, treat it as work.</li>
<li>Great writing has complicated nuance and is resistant to ideology. Don't hedge.</li>
<li>Experiment with projects and styles to find your voice.</li>
<li>Literary criticism deepens understanding, offering insights even when we disagree.</li>
<li>Write to work something through and it might help someone else do the same.</li>
<li>Playwriting hones precision and editorial skill, maximizing impact through brevity.</li>
<li>Love stories are the hardest to write. They need to resist cynicism and exude grace.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="day-3-session-4">Day 3: Edenglassie</h2>
<p><strong>Featured Melissa Lucashenko and Terri-Ann White.</strong></p>
<p cite="http://www.mildurawritersfestival.com/uploads/1/2/1/7/121719570/mwf_digital_program24.pdf" class="quotes">"Winner of the Miles Franklin award for Too Much Lip talks about her novel, Edenglassie. Set in Brisbane, two extraordinary stories, five generations apart, debunk colonial myths and reimagine an Australian future."</p>
<ul>
<li>Nature can be a character as much as humans can.</li>
<li>Exploring duality is rich ground for ideas.</li>
<li>To write good non-fiction, find the sweet spot between fascinating and funny.</li>
<li>Humor softens the blow of uncomfortable truths.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="day-3-session-5">Day 3: How Reading Makes Us Human</h2>
<p><strong>Featured Angela Savage, Christos Tsiolkas, Charlotte Wood, Melissa Lucashenko + <a href="http://www.namleonline.com/">Nam Lee</a>.</strong></p>
<p cite="http://www.mildurawritersfestival.com/uploads/1/2/1/7/121719570/mwf_digital_program24.pdf" class="quotes">"An unmissable discussion with a panel of deep thinkers and accomplished writers about the value of reading."</p>
<ul>
<li>Stories shape our identity, stirring emotion, sparking wonder, and offering escape.</li>
<li>You can time travel and exchange minds through reading.</li>
<li>It helps us feel less alone in the world.</li>
<li>You can write something simple and still imbue it with deep meaning.</li>
<li>Culture teaches us passive consumption to the detriment of nuance.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="day-4-session-1">Day 4: The Great Beauty</h2>
<p><strong>Featured Christos Tsiolkas.</strong></p>
<p cite="http://www.mildurawritersfestival.com/uploads/1/2/1/7/121719570/mwf_digital_program24.pdf" class="quotes">"With a literary career spanning thirty years, our 2024 guest speaker is hailed as one of the most significant contemporary storytellers at work today. His talk investigates how film as an art form has influenced his writing. The Murray Talk is presented by an esteemed writer on any subject. It was established in dedication to the memory of our festival patron, the late Les Murray, and the enduring vitality of the Murray River."</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't confuse imagination with ideology.</li>
<li>Don't immediately judge. You might be surprised.</li>
<li>Divorced from empathy and nuance, overused language loses meaning.</li>
<li>When we overvalue immediacy or certainty, we lose something.</li>
<li>There are questions we'll never answer. That's okay.</li>
<li>We shy away from conflict to our detriment.</li>
<li>We're pushed to oversimplify and feign certainty, even when 'I don't know' is truest.</li>
<li>To make outstanding work, balance the broken and the beautiful.</li>
<li>Often the anger we feel facing problems is learned helplessness.</li>
<li>Faith, love, and hope are ridiculous, but they keep us alive.</li>
<li>Art helps us see the world anew.</li>
<li>When reading fiction, we don't disappear, but our existence becomes liminal.</li>
<li>Most media reinforces boundaries and biases rather than questioning them.</li>
<li>The apocalypse is always happening.</li>
<li>In building a better future, don't forget the now.</li>
<li>Embrace doubt.</li>
<li>Art doesn't have to be intellectual. The simplest moments captured are still profound.</li>
<li>Creative works are always collaborative. </li>
<li>There's no sorrow without joy, no joy without sorrow.</li>
<li>When everything rages, we need the quiet.</li>
