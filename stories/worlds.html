<p id="top" class="quotes">At the edge of a war-ravaged world, she and her brother flee through a haunted abyss, chased by shadows. Their only hope lies in the light beyond.</p>
<p>They’ve come to the edge of the earth. Towards the horizon, the water disappears into an abyss. Once sparkling and clear, the waters are littered with the wreckage of war. The ocean refuses to replenish the broken souls who beg for relief. One can’t help others if they’re shattered.</p>
<p>She flinches at the cool touch of salt on her skin. It stings her nose and lungs. She can’t breathe as salty tears stream down her face. Why is the ocean turning on them? The ocean is changing again, flowing upwards like a tidal wave. It swirls and ripples. The sky is a dark gray and the sun’s light breaks through the thick clouds. She can’t bear to witness the sight.</p>
<p>She stares into the grim horizon where a lone ship sails toward them. Bristling with the stolen weaponry of a thousand plundered worlds, the ship of conquerors sails closer and closer, preparing to shell the shore with flames.</p>
<p>What comes next is war machines shooting projectiles into homes, shattering windows into tiny slivers of glass, and decimating entire neighborhoods. The taste of salt and blood in her mouth for the rest of her days, no matter how much water she drinks. There’s no escape from the brutality of their enemies.</p>
<p>It’s not safe anywhere. Not anymore. Fire burned the people on the ships. The endless thrum of shells blasting her beloved island to pieces. She didn’t know if she could forgive herself. Instead, she wants to remember what it was like before her world shattered. A distant wave echoes off the cliffs.</p>
<p>Salt air and algae-ridden beaches linger after the storm. The wind whips through her hair, soothing her mind. They have minutes to make it through.</p>
<p>“Sister?” In her overwhelming numbness, she’s forgotten her brother stands by her. He’s so young and frightened. She doesn’t want to lie to him. Everything falls apart around them. Like a sickening disease spreading through the body before erupting into sharp stabs of exhaustion.</p>
<p>“I’m scared. Where are we going?” he asks, clutching her arm as if she’s his lifeline.</p>
<p>“Somewhere where we’ll be protected.” They have nothing left in this world. It’s time to leave it behind. She gives him what she hopes is a reassuring squeeze and says, “Come on.”</p>
<p>She turns away from her home one last time, taking her brother’s hand, and walks into oblivion. They’re the only thing in the endless black. She sees the faces of those who died because of her mistakes. They scream for vengeance. She must keep breathing. For her brother’s sake, she endures.</p>
<p>If she’d had a better state of mind, she might have marveled at the intoxicating, psychedelic sight. The bridge is underneath her feet and holds her there, but it shimmers like a river reflecting the sun. Light comes from nowhere and forms dancing particles. Salty humidity and thick, oppressive heat slow their steps to an excruciating crawl.</p>
<p>Alongside her brother, she watches as the aurora dances in the distance. They walk across the floating bridge between worlds, a span that’s all too long. She sees them. Shadows of the lost souls, trapped between universes, beckon to her. Ignoring them is the only thing to keep her from crumbling. An eternity passes, and they’ve made no progress.</p>
<p>There’s a sensation, as though something is stalking them. A shiver goes down her spine. The shadowy figures have followed them. “We’re almost there,” she whispers, and he nods, his eyes wide.</p>
<p>She’s led him through this journey from their home, through the darkness of the great divide. Everything she does is to keep him safe. The shadows are closer, but she doesn’t dare look away from her brother. He is all she has left – it’s up to her to protect him. She has to get him out.</p>
<p>The shadows are upon them. She squeezes his hand, her heart beating out of control. An icy feather touches her cheek, and she looks at an owl. It wears ancient armor, its pointed ears waving as it speaks in an eerie whisper, “You are safe here.”</p>
<p>She shakes her head and grips his hand tighter. If she has to die, it’ll be fighting to protect him.</p>
<p>The souls tear towards them with vacant eyes that burn into her skin as their wordless mouths scream to be saved. Their limbs stretch out, begging to be freed. She can’t help them, no matter how she wants to. They flee, desperate to shake the ghosts. With every step they take, her heart breaks. There’s nothing left for them but this eternal flight.</p>
<p>The notion weighs on her. It holds her back, slowing her escape for a moment before she pushes forward again and carries him into safety. The souls will never stop chasing them until they have what they want: freedom from this void and whatever misery they’d been through. Her heart pounds, their howls thundering in her ears.</p>
<p>One could only hope everything was what she wanted. She can’t let herself think what’d happen if she didn’t get her wish. As soon as they reach the end of the bridge, she looks back at the souls. They stand on the edge of this world, watching them with empty eyes.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry!” she cries, her fractured heart breaking. They scramble into the light and are pierced by pain. Shards in their eyes, knives turning over inside them and ripping away at their skin – but there’s no blood to be spilled. “We’re here!” she screams. The new world swallows them whole.</p>
