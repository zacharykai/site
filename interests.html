<h1>Interests</h1>
<p class="postmeta"><strong>Published</strong>: 28 Jun 2024 | <strong>Updated</strong>: 11 Jul 2024</p>
<p id="top">My contribution to /interests, compiled by Chris Burnell. <a href="https://chrisburnell.github.io/interests-directory/" target="_blank">See more folks' here</a>. These are my (many, varied) fascinations.</p>
<h2>Food</h2>
<p>Learning about the culture, history, and art of making food is endlessly fascinating. Hence why I listen to the podcast GastroPod! I've only started baking in the last few years, and who knew it involved so much chemistry?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cuisines</strong>: Japanese, Mexican, Spanish, Thai.</li>
<li><strong>Foods</strong>: Sourdough, pretzels, chickpeas, pintos, nuts, seeds, capsicum, eggplant, green beans, leaves, snowpeas.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Literature</h2>
<p>Books! My greatest love! I learned to read at four and never stopped (I'll read the salt shaker label if desperate.) I only started tracking the books I've read in 2020, but I've read thousands by now. I read to learn, to escape, to grow, to live.</p>
<p>Fittingly, I love literary history, bookbinding, zines, magazines, author talks, and of course, books on books.</p>
<p>My favorite books are The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald and Railhead by Philip Reeve.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authors</strong>: Alice Oseman, Becky Chambers, Cal Newport, Rick Riordan, Ryan Holiday.</li>
<li><strong>Subjects</strong>: Anthropology, Contemporary Fiction, Fantasy, History, Media Studies, Philosophy, Psychology, Queer, Romance, Scifi, Social Sciences, Technology, Young Adult.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Miscellanea</h2>
<p>Though I don't watch much Film or TV (it's too overstimulating,) I've loved everything Star Wars, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Cleopatra In Space, Glitchtechs, Gravity Falls, Kipo & The Age Of The Wonderbeasts, Kubo & The Two Strings, Rise Of The Guardians, She-Ra, The Dragon Prince, and The Hollow.</p>
<h2>Music</h2>
<p>I adore music! I listen to it for hours on end, when working, making, doing chores... I've had the same bands/songs on rotation for years, and I never grow tired of them! Perhaps I find comfort in the sameness.</p>
<p>Like most things, I go through phases of hyperfixation on an artist: first it was Vexento, then Coldplay, then The Spacies, and now, The 1975.</p>
<p>Most music I enjoy draws towards downtempo, minor key, introspective/clever lyrics, softer sounds, but sometimes I surprise myself.</p>
<p>They say your taste in music is set by your late twenties, so please, help me diversify before then!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Artists</strong>: ARIZONA, ayokay, Cavetown, Coldplay, Dayglow, Flor, Gorillaz, Half-Alive, John Mayer, Kid Bloom, Kygo, LP, Mat Kearney, Mumford & Sons, Nightly, ODESZA, Of Monsters & Men, Oh Wonder,  Petit Biscuit, Porter Robinson, Post Malone, The 1975, The Chainsmokers, The Japanese House, The Midnight, The Spacies, Vexento, Yoste.</li>
<li><strong>Genres</strong>: Alternative, Chamber Pop, Chillstep, Folk, Indie, Lofi, Pop-punk, Pop-rock, Shoegaze, Synthwave, Tropical House.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Travel</h2>
<p>I'm fortuante enough to have traveled to eleven countries: Mexico, Spain, Italy, Romania, Moldova, Japan, Australia, Taiwan, the UK, the Netherlands, and Thailand.</p> 
<p>Each has left me with a wealth of experience, fascination, and facts to savor. I'd love to visit South America, Portugal, and France.</p>
<h2>Tech</h2>
<p>Given how I adore everything to do with the written word, it makes sense I'm drawn to tech. The internet is my everything, I wouldn't be without it.</p>
<p>Teaching myself to code, building a website, contributing my thoughts to the web... It's one of the scariest things I've done, but also so rewarding.</p>
<p>I'm fascinated by digital culture, internet history and linguistics, personal websites, and the 'poetic' web.</p>
<p>Though I'm but an amatuer programmer, I rely on open-source projects, and would love to contribute. Not sure which language I'd learn!</p> 
<h2>Do We Have Something In Common?</h2>
