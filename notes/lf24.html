<h2>Session #1: Little Fates</h2>
<p><strong>Featuring <a href="https://www.wheelercentre.com/people/danny-soberano" target="_blank">Danny Soberano</a> & <a href="https://yanyiii.com/" target="_blank">Yanyi</a>.</strong></p>
<p class="quotes" cite="https://www.wheelercentre.com/events-tickets/season-2024/little-fates-yanyi-and-danny-soberano">"Yanyi and Danny examine poetic form as a tool for untangling the self and our surrounds. How is a person known? Perhaps in the way their coffee cools; as Danny Soberano writes: ‘I knew even then / that I was changed’. Or perhaps, as Yanyi writes, it is in the hanging of a poster, or the stringing of lights across the wall. In poetry, each detail matters tenfold and weighs a tonne, but still floats easy, steam off hot coffee. In this conversation, Yanyi and Danny examine the poetic form as a tool for untangling the self and our surrounds."</p>
<ul>
<li>Cooking is a renewable skill: it keeps on giving.</li>
<li>When trying to make a positive contribution to a community, intentionality and focus is as important as it is in writing. The tinner you spread yourself, the less impact you'll have.</li>
<li>Write when no one can disturb you.</li>
<li>Concentrating for blocks of time makes space for creativity. Carve it out.</li>
<li>Write first drafts in long form prose regardless of the desired finished format to work out what you want to say and get the thoughts out.</li>
<li>Treat firsts drafts ass ideation to spark future works. Don't expect too much and let the work breathe.</li>
<li>Experiment with poetic forms to break them for powerful endings.</li>
<li>Poems are life companions.</li>
<li>Doubt is scary yet embracing it gives us rick soil to explore in our work.</li>
<li>When you write to discover what you think, it's an exciting yet uncertain process. That's what makes it so rewarding yet terrifying.</li>
<li>There's so much we don't and will never know. Poetry and prose are a chance to discover our truth.</li>
<li>Institutions and belief systems don't allow for doubt as it threatens their existence.</li>
<li>The longer you live, the less surprised you feel when trying something different.</li>
<li>Creativity goes through seasons.</li>
<li>Expressing doubt is a statement of being a free-thinking individual.</li>
<li>Reading is the only way to experience another life as if it were yours.</li>
<li>If anything you want doesn't exist, create it.</li>
<li>Archives are a community strengthener and preserver of literary history.</li>
<li>Experiences come direct from the body to the page.</li>
<li>Books as archives.</li>
<li>A weekly reflection creates a record of your existence, memories kept you'd otherwise lose.</li>
<li>Literature isn't the point. Human connection is.</li>
<li>Through reading, you connect to the dead, and the living who no longer exist.</li>
<li>Read the collected correspondence of writers for beautiful insights and turns of phrase.</li>
<li>Poetry helps us process experiences.</li>
<li>There's no such thing as a singular history.</li>
<li>Poetry's rhythm has sped up as society has.</li>
<li>Write in the voice of those you adore until there's nothing left but yours.</li>
<li>When you love the work, the separation between life and it disappears.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Session #2: Linework</h2>
<p><strong>Featuring <a href="https://www.nationalbook.org/people/lee-lai/" target="_blank">Lee Lai</a> and <a href="https://www.jilliantamaki.com/" target="_blank">Jillian Tamaki</a>.</strong></p>
<p cite="https://www.wheelercentre.com/events-tickets/season-2024/linework-jillian-tamaki-and-lee-lai" class="quotes">In this conversation, Lee Lai and Jillian Tamaki examine the tactile and embodied nature of comics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Promoting a creative work is a signal that project and life stage has finished.</li>
<li>It's okay to not be happy with past work, it shows you're improving. But let it be.</li>
<li>Dissatisfaction is a great motivator.</li>
<li>Being a beginner is a beautiful state of mind when creating. You're unencumbered.</li>
<li>Finishing things is one of the best things you can do for yourself as a maker. Get to good enough.</li>
<li>Books are eras of your existence.</li>
<li>The more you start and end the creative process, there less you have to fear.</li>
<li>Goals forever need remaking. Otherwise you're stuck in a loop of asking 'what now?'</li>
<li>You think the most satisfying thing about making stuff is the finished result, but if you want it to be a lifelong practice, you need to fall in love with the process.</li>
<li>Art doesn't have to perform usefulness. Your artmaking is one facet of your skills, many of which you possess in being able to make a positive contribution.</li>
<li>You have no obligation to speak to the moment through what you make.</li>
<li>Think of the studio as a laboratory, not a factory.</li>
<li>Strategic thinking based on the old way of doing things quickly falls apart. To survive in an ever-changing world, you also need flexibility.</li>
<li>Life is uncertainty. If you can't accept that, everything is hard.</li>
<li>When the tools available rise everyone to the same level, to stand out means being extraordinary.</li>
<li>When algorithms don't introduce you to the art you want, you need to seek it out. It's still there.</li>
<li>Embrace your fixations and learn all you can.</li>
<li>There's no one right way to appreciating art. Learn, and be inspired.</li>
<li>A work's medium and the ways of presenting it create a world of possibilities.</li>
<li>Something's execution doesn't matter as much as the intention and the meaning the audience is left with.</li>
<li>When attention is scattered and short-lived, the highest compliment is sustained, careful noticing.</li>
