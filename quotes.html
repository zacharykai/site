<ul>
<li><em>"The manifesto is this: Draw the art you want to see, start the business you want to run, play the music you want to hear, write the books you want to read, build the products you want to use—do the work you want to see done."</em>  — Austin Kleon</li>
<li><em>“My interest in making music has been to create something that does not exist that I would like to listen to. I wanted to hear music that had not yet happened, by putting together things that suggested a new thing which did not yet exist.”</em> — Brian Eno</li>
<li><em>“You start out as a phony and become real.”</em> — Glenn O’Brien</li>
<li><em>“We are shaped and fashioned by what we love.”</em> — Goethe</li>
<li><em>“Steal from anywhere that resonates with inspiration or fuels your imagination. Devour old films, new films, music, books, paintings, photographs, poems, dreams, random conversations, architecture, bridges, street signs, trees, clouds, bodies of water, light and shadows. Select only things to steal from that speak directly to your soul. If you do this, your work (and theft) will be authentic.”</em> — Jim Jarmusch</li>
<li><em>“We don’t know where we get our ideas from. What we do know is that we do not get them from our laptops.”</em> — John Cleese</li>
<li><em>“In the digital age, don’t forget to use your digits!"</em> — Lynda Barry</li>
<li><em>“I don’t believe in art. I believe in artists.”</em> — Marcel Duchamp</li>
<li><em>“It is better to take what does not belong to you than to let it lie around neglected.”</em> — Mark Twain</li>
<li><em>“Art is theft.”</em> — Pablo Picasso</li>
<li><em>“Those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing.”</em> — Salvador Dalí</li>
<li><em>“What is originality? Undetected plagiarism.”</em> — William Ralph Inge</li>
<li><em>"If you copy from one author, it’s plagiarism, but if you copy from many, it’s research."</em> — Wilson Mizner</li>
<li><em>“Start copying what you love. Copy copy copy copy. At the end of the copy you will find your self.”</em> — Yohji Yamamoto</li>
</ul>
